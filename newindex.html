                    For now, our “frugal innovation camps”- schedule will look like this. If we experience the same high interests as our very first (and only) innovation camp, we will add more events.

                    We in Inova are a newly formed company. Our focus is around frugal innovation, and in order to spread our experience with this innovation, we want to host innovation camps. Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frugal_innovation) describes frugal innovation the best: “Frugal innovation, or frugal engineering, is the process of reducing the complexity and cost of a good and its production. Usually this refers to removing nonessential features from a durable good, such as a car or phone, in order to sell it in developing countries”. Not only will these innovation camps teach the participants about frugal innovation, but we get to help more developing countries by raising money, getting the word out and awareness around this type of innovation.
