# Make-It-Responsive
"In this assignment, you will be challenged to create the most accessible website, in groups of three to five. You have to fulfill the business case (see appendix) to the best of your ability and make the most accessible and satisfying user experience. This includes user testing the responsiveness of the website, automated testing and maintaining an accessibility score of higher than 90% on all pages in the website (http://checkers.eiii.eu/)."
"Business case:
Inova is a newly formed company in need of a website. Their business is focused around frugal innovation, and in order to spread their experience with frugal innovation, they want to host innovation camps. They are open to suggestions on what their website should look like and include, but they ask that it at least includes: 
-	Information about the company and what they do. 
-	Information about the staff members (Please create your own fantasy staff)
-	Schedule for the future innovation camps
-	Contact information
Inova really cares about accessibility and universal design, and they therefore ask that their new website is designed to be accessible to all."
